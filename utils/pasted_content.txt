# 🧠 Prompt: Build Full Streamlit App for “Polish A1 Voice Tutor”

I want you to build a Streamlit-based language learning app called **Polish A1 Voice Tutor**. This is a voice-first study tool for CEFR A1-level learners, combining vocabulary review, quizzes, conversation practice, grammar insights, spaced repetition, gamification, and more. The final app must be fully functional with modular code, CSV-based persistence, and clear folder structure.

Please use the two markdown documents below as your detailed implementation references:

- **[lang-prd-updated.md](./lang-prd-updated.md)** — Product Requirements Document
- **[lang-readme-updated.md](./lang-readme-updated.md)** — Complete app spec + folder layout

## 🎯 Core Deliverables

1. **Streamlit App (app.py)** that includes:
   - Home dashboard with:
     - Word of the Day
     - Streak tracker
     - Daily goal progress
   - Tabs or sidebar for:
     - Word Bank
     - Quiz Mode (voice + text input)
     - Conversation Practice (AI plays roles)
     - Story Mode
     - Review Deck (spaced repetition)
     - Settings
   - Built-in audio input/output using Whisper, pyttsx3, or Google STT

2. **Utility modules** in `/utils`:
   - `srs_engine.py` — spaced repetition logic
   - `pronunciation.py` — speech scoring with feedback
   - `quiz_generator.py` — smart quiz builder
   - `story_mode.py` — graded stories with Q&A
   - `xp_badges.py` — tracks XP, badges, and streaks
   - `sms_reminder.py` — optional SMS via Twilio
   - `ambient_mode.py` — continuous conversation with auto-pause
   - `goals.py` — daily/weekly goal tracking
   - `grammar_tipper.py`, `culture_tip.py` — inject tips by context
   - `voice_io.py` — handles all voice input/output

3. **Data files** in `/data` folder (use dummy starter content):
   - `word_bank.csv`
   - `users.csv`
   - `quiz_log.csv`
   - `stories.csv`
   - `leaderboard.csv`
   - `grammar_tips.json`
   - `culture_notes.json`

4. **Gamification logic**:
   - Earn XP for quizzes, stories, practice
   - Badges for milestones (5-day streak, 100 XP, etc.)
   - Leaderboard sorted weekly by XP

5. **Reminders + SMS feature**:
   - User can set reminder time in Settings
   - Option to enter phone number for daily SMS (via Twilio)
   - Supports timezone and phone validation

6. **Word of the Day system**:
   - Rotates through words from `word_bank.csv`
   - Includes pronunciation audio and usage

7. **Custom AI Tutor Voices**:
   - User selects from voice styles: “Tutor Magda”, “Coach Piotr”, “Professor Jan”
   - Affects tone/style of TTS and response phrasing

## 🧪 Tech Stack Requirements

- **Streamlit** frontend
- **Whisper / Wav2Vec2 / Google STT** for speech recognition
- **pyttsx3 or gTTS** for TTS
- **Twilio API** for SMS
- **CSV or SQLite** persistence (keep it local and simple)
- **Modular Python code** organized by function

## ✅ Expectations

- Follow README + PRD exactly
- Keep all logic reusable and clean
- Use st.session_state or a simple store to track streaks, goal progress, and quiz history
- Ensure it works **offline if needed** for core features (except SMS)
- Test with mock data for quizzes and stories
